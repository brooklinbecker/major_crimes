	abstract = {Tandis que la littérature évaluant diverses pratiques et reformes policières continue de s’accroitre, il y a présentement peu de recherche qui examine le financement de la police au Canada. Pour décrire la situation présente du financement de la police au Canada, nous recueillissions et publions des données sur les dépenses municipales de services policiers de 2010 à 2021 de 20 des municipalités urbaines les plus peuplées au Canada. Notre analyse décrit le changement du financement de la police au cours du temps et la variation entre les différentes régions, et examine la corrélation entre le financement et les taux de crime. Les dépenses sur les services policiers sont extraits des budgets municipaux, et les données sur les populations et sur l’indice de gravité de la criminalité sont extraits des bases de données de Statistique Canada. En 2019, les services policiers étaient la plus grande dépense de fonctionnement dans une majorité des municipalités. Les montants des dépenses par habitant en dollars constants sur les services policiers augmentent dans 16/20 municipalités entre 2010 et 2020. Il y a des différences marquées entre les dépenses des municipalités : en 2019, en dollars 2020, Vancouver a dépensé \$495.84 par habitant pendant que la Ville de Québec a dépensé \$217.05 par habitant. Il n’y a pas de corrélations uniformes entre les dépenses policières et les taux de crime des municipalités. Cependant, des augmentations nettes de dépenses par habitant ne sont pas associées avec des réductions plus importantes de taux de crime. Ces résultats décrivent la grande variation locale des tendances de fonds policiers, et indiquent la complexité des interactions entre les taux de crime et les fonds policiers.

            Although the literature evaluating various police practices and reforms continues to broaden, little research has examined police funding in Canada. To describe the current landscape of Canada's police funding, we collect and publish data on municipal police service expenditures from 2010 to 2021 in 20 of the most populous urban municipalities in Canada. Our analysis describes how police funding changes over time and varies between regions, and it examines its correlation with crime rates. Spending on police services is extracted from municipal budgets, and population and crime severity index data are collected from Statistics Canada databases. In 2019, police services were the top operating expenditure in a majority of the municipalities. Real per capita spending on police services increased in 16 of 20 municipalities from 2010 to 2020. Marked differences are seen in spending between municipalities: in 2019, in 2020 dollars, Vancouver spent \$495.84 per capita, whereas Quebec City spent \$217.05 per capita. No consistent associations were found between police funding and crime rates across municipalities, and overall, net increases in spending per capita are not associated with greater net decreases in crime rates. These findings describe the wide local variation in police funding trends and point to the complexity of interactions between crime rates and police funding.},

              Objectives
              Homicide rate is associated with a large variety of factors and therefore unevenly distributed over time and space. This study aims to explore homicide patterns and their spatial associations with different socioeconomic and built-environment conditions in 140 neighbourhoods of the city of Toronto, Canada.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A homicide dataset covering the years 2012 to 2021 and neighbourhood-based indicators were analysed using spatial techniques such as Kernel Density Estimation, Global/Local Moran’s
                I
                and Kulldorff’s {SatScan} spatio-temporal methodology. Geographically weighted regression ({GWR}) and multi-scale {GWR} ({MGWR}) were used to analyse the spatially varying correlations between the homicide rate and independent variables. The latter was particularly suitable for manifested spatial variations between explanatory variables and the homicide rate and it also identified spatial non-stationarities in this connection.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                The adjusted R
                2
                of the {MGWR} was 0.53, representing a 4.35 and 3.74\% increase from that in the linear regression and {GWR} models, respectively. Spatial and spatio-temporal high-risk areas were found to be significantly clustered in downtown and the north-western parts of the city. Some variables (e.g., the population density, material deprivation, the density of commercial establishments and the density of large buildings) were significantly associated with the homicide rate in different spatial ways.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              The findings of this study showed that homicide rates were clustered over time and space in certain areas of the city. Socioeconomic and the built environment characteristics of some neighbourhoods were found to be associated with high homicide rates but these factors were different for each neighbourhood.},
