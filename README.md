# Measuring Material Progression in Toronto’s Major Crime Frequency

## Abstract
The data set **Major Crime Indicators** from City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal was analyzed to assess the Toronto Police Service’s eﬀicacy in reducing major crime frequency in high-risk neighbourhoods from 2014 to 2023. The analysis indicates minimal decline in crime rates in these neighbourhoods compared to others over the decade. This lack of progress suggests the Toronto Police Service has not significantly reduced major crime frequency in high-risk areas during this period. To explore potential causes, the analysis includes the Toronto Police Service’s Operating Impact and examines the intricate relationships among socio-economic factors, policing, and major crime rates.
